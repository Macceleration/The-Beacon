## 🌟 Overview  

**The Beacon** is a platform for **Hyperlocal Live Games** — interactive, real-world gaming experiences where your city, neighborhood, or even your favorite hangout becomes the arena.  

We’re redefining what it means to “go out and play.” Instead of screens separating players, **The Beacon** connects people face-to-face through challenges, events, and real-time adventures that blend **digital gameplay with physical spaces.**

## 🎯 What is "Hyperlocal Live Gaming"?  

**Hyperlocal Live Gaming** means games that:  

- 🌍 Take place in **real locations** — parks, cafés, rooftops, and public squares.  
- ⚡ Happen **live**, syncing players and events in real time.  
- 👥 Are **community-driven**, connecting players nearby through shared experiences.  

Think of it as the intersection between **gaming, events, and urban exploration** — where the **real world is your arena.**
